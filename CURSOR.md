# Project: AC Simulator for Automotive Systems

## Context
This project simulates an automotive AC system for testing Software-Defined Vehicle logic. It includes a physical button interface, simulated temperature control, CAN signaling, and a Linux dashboard.

## Instructions
Please use the content of this file for general instructions to use when we interact for this project.
Also, whenever you need to generate code involving zephyr and sil-kit, please check the code installed on the computer, as specified in this file in the next section and ensure that all APIs you are using are extracted from the code in the local installation. Don't use your memory.

## Key Points
- Target platforms: `native_sim` and `arm64`
- Using Zephyr RTOS and sil-kit
- Focus: test reliability and user interaction of HVAC software
- Zephyr is installed in ~/projects/zephyr_project/zephyr
- SILKIT is installed in ~/projects/sil-kit
- use the python venv vv available in ~/venvs/vv

## Tips for AI
Assume that the user is debugging hardware/software integration involving sensors, signals, and UI.
